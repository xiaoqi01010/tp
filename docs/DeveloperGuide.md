## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the app.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-patient 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `CaringSessionsPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Patient` and `CaringSession` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

#### Sequence Diagram — Edit Command

The diagram below shows how `AddressBookParser`, `EditCommandParser`, `EditDescriptor`, and `LogicManager`
interact when parsing and executing an `edit` command.
<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePatientCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`, `DeletePatientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the data i.e., all `Patient` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePatientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Patient` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both the data and user preferences in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.noknock.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Viewing Caring Sessions for Today/This Week

#### Implementation

The viewing feature is implemented through `CaringSessionPanel`, which gathers all caring sessions from patients and groups them by date for display.

**Key Components**

* **`CaringSessionPanel`**: Builds and manages the flattened list of grouped sessions.
* **`GroupedCaringSessionCell`**: Renders either a date header or a session card depending on item type.
* **`CaringSessionCard`**: Displays individual session details such as patient name, care type, time, and status.
* **`DateHeader`**: Represents the date grouping shown above sessions of the same day.

Below is the partial class diagram for the **UI layer**, showing the key display components and their relationships.

<puml src="diagrams/CaringSessionViewUIClassDiagram.puml" alt="Caring Session View UI Class Diagram" />

The **Model layer** defines how patient and session data are structured and linked.

<puml src="diagrams/CaringSessionViewModelClassDiagram.puml" alt="Caring Session View Model Class Diagram" />

**Process Overview**

1. `CaringSessionPanel` receives an `ObservableList<Patient>` from the model.
2. All sessions are collected, sorted by date and time, and grouped using a `LinkedHashMap<Date, List<PatientCaringSession>>`.
3. A flattened list is built by alternating `DateHeader` and `PatientCaringSession` items.
4. `GroupedCaringSessionCell` renders each entry as either a header or a `CaringSessionCard`.
5. Any model update triggers a view refresh automatically.

The sequence below illustrates this flow at runtime.

<puml src="diagrams/CaringSessionViewSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Caring Session View Sequence Diagram" />

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Nursing home staff who need to manage many patients and their Next-of-Kin (NOK) contacts
* Prefer command-line interfaces over GUIs for speed and efficiency
* Can type fast and are comfortable using text-based systems
* Need to track patient information, NOK details, and daily caring sessions
* Value lightweight, reliable tools that reduce manual paperwork and coordination errors

**Value proposition**: Replace manual scheduling and contact-tracking methods with a fast,
CLI-based system that improves coordination, safety, and productivity in elderly care.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above-average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Core operations (searches, contact updates, session scheduling) should have response times **<= 200 milliseconds** under normal and peak load; under extreme conditions response times must remain **<= 1 second**.
5. Startup time should not exceed **2 seconds** on a standard laptop.
6. The app must not crash during adding / update / delete operations.
7. Data integrity must be guaranteed if the program exits unexpectedly (use atomic writes, journaling, or equivalent).

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

These instructions combine quick-start steps and feature-specific test cases to provide a practical checklist for manual testing. They are a starting point; testers should perform additional exploratory testing.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Commands shown use the CLI\/GUI command box. Replace `INDEX`, `PATIENT_INDEX`, `NOK_INDEX`, `SESSION_INDEX`, `NAME`, `IC_NUMBER`, `WARD`, `DATE`, `TIME`, `CARE_TYPE`, `PHONE`, `RELATIONSHIP`, `NOTES` with appropriate values.

</box>

### Launch and quick start

1. Initial launch
    1. Place the jar file in an empty folder.
    2. Run `java -jar noknock.jar` (or double-click the jar).
        - Expected: GUI opens with sample data and command box visible.
    3. Try `help`.
        - Expected: Help window opens / help message shows.

2. Quick start commands (verify basic command parsing and responses)
    1. `list-patients` — Expected: table or list of patients or `No patients in the system`.
    2. `add-patient n/Dylan ic/S1234567A w/2A` — Expected: `New patient added: Dylan`.
    3. `add-nok 1 n/Oad p/6598765432 r/son` — Expected: `Added NextOfKin: Oad to Patient: Yue Yang`.
    4. `sessions-today` — Expected: list of today's sessions or `Today's caring sessions: 0 patients`.
    5. `exit` — Expected: application exits cleanly.

3. Window preferences
    1. Resize/move window and close.
    2. Re-launch the app.
        - Expected: previous window size and position restored (preferences saved).

### Patient management

#### Add patient

Add patient to NOKnock

1. Command: `add-patient n/Name ic/IC_NUMBER w/WARD [t/TAG]...`
2. Expected: success message with name and IC.
3. Edge cases: add with duplicate IC → `A patient with this IC already exists in the database`. Missing params → parameter-specific error.
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
#### List and view

List and view all patients in the database.

1. Test case: `list-patients` \
   Expected: all patients.
2. Test case: `view-patient 1` \
   Expected: full profile including NOKs and sessions.
3. Test case: `view-patient 999` (Invalid Index where index > size)
   Expected: Index Error → `The patient index provided is invalid`.

#### Edit patient

Edit a patient's details.

1. Test Case: `edit-patient 1 n/Bob w/1A`  \
   Expected: The first patient's name and ward are updated to "Bob" and "1A" respectively.
2. Test Case: Invalid index \
   Expected: Index Error
3. Test Case: duplicate IC \
   Expected: Duplicate Error

#### Delete patient (important: cascades)

Prerequisites: Ensure multiple patients listed with `list-patients`.

1. Test case: `delete-patient 1` \
   Expected: patient deleted and related NOKs/sessions removed; status message updated.
2. Test case: `delete-patient 0` / `delete-patient` / `delete-patient x` where x > size \
   Expected: error message, no deletion.

### Next-of-Kin (NOK) management

#### Add NOK

1. Test case: `add-nok PATIENT_INDEX n/NAME p/PHONE r/RELATIONSHIP` \
   Expected: Success message.
2. Test case: Duplicate NOK with same name and phone for same patient \
   Expected: Duplicate error. Message → `This next of kin already exists for this patient`.

#### Edit NOK

1. Test case: `edit-nok PATIENT_INDEX NOK_INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [r/RELATIONSHIP]`\
   Expected: updated NOK message or error if patient/NOK not found.

#### Delete NOK

1. `delete-nok PATIENT_INDEX NOK_INDEX` — Expected: success message, or `The patient/Next-of-Kin index provided is invalid`.

### Caring session management

#### Add session

1. Command: `add-session PATIENT_INDEX d/DATE time/TIME type/CARE_TYPE [notes/NOTES]` \
   Expected: `Caring session added for <NAME>: <TYPE> on <DATE> at <TIME>`. Invalid date/time → parameter-specific error.
2. Example: `add-session 1 d/2024-12-25 time/14:30 type/medication notes/Give insulin shot` \

#### Edit session

1. `edit-session PATIENT_INDEX SESSION_INDEX [d/DATE] [time/TIME] [type/CARE_TYPE] [notes/NOTES] [status/STATUS]`
2. Example: `edit-session 1 2 d/2024-12-25 time/14:30 status/completed`
3. Expected: `Edited CaringSession: <TYPE> on <DATE> at <TIME> of Patient: <NAME>`.

#### Delete session

1`delete-session PATIENT_INDEX SESSION_INDEX` — Expected: session removed message or `The patient/caring session index provided is invalid`.

#### Views

1. `sessions-today` — Expected: today's sessions list or `Today's caring sessions: 0 patients`.
2. `sessions-week` — Expected: this week's sessions or `This week's caring sessions: 0 patients`.

Sequence diagram for `sessions-today` command.

#### Complete session

1. Mark complete via `edit-session` with `status/completed` or dedicated command if present.
2. Already completed → `Session already completed`.

### Finding / searching

#### Find patients by name

1. `find-patient KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`
2. Expected: list of matching patients (case-insensitive, partial match) or `No patients found matching: ...`.

#### Find by NOK name

1. `find-by-nok KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`
2. Expected: patients matched via NOK name or `No patients found with NOK matching: ...`.

### Saving and data integrity

#### Automatic saving

Modify data (add/edit/delete). Close app and reopen.

- Expected: changes persisted in `data/addressbook.json` next to the jar.

### Corrupted/missing data file

1. Simulate: rename or corrupt `data/addressbook.json`.
2. Launch app.
    - Expected: app starts with empty data and creates a fresh data file; warn user (follow the app's documented behavior). Backup file before editing manually.

#### Backup and restore manual test (if supported)

Export/backup, then restore, verify data matches original.

### Example test session (regression checklist)

1. Launch app.
2. `add-patient n/Test ic/T1234567A w/1B`
3. `list-patients` → confirm presence.
4. `add-nok 1 n/Lee p/651234567 r/daughter`
5. `add-session 1 d/2025-12-01 time/09:00 type/hygiene notes/Assist with shower`
6. `view-patient 1` → confirm NOK and session shown.
7. `edit-session 1 1 status/completed`
8. `delete-nok 1 1`
9. `delete-patient 1`
10. Close and reopen app → confirm persistent state matches expectations.

## Notes

- For every test case, record command, expected output, actual output, and pass/fail.
- Tests that modify state should be followed by verification steps (e.g., `list-patients`, `view-patient`).
- Automated unit tests should complement manual tests; aim for coverage of edge cases (invalid params, out-of-range indices, duplicate entries).
