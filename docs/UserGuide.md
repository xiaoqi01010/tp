# NOKnock User Guide

<!--* Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

## What is NOKnock?

Do you have trouble keeping track of the care your patients need? Do you wish that you didn't have to go through entire Excel sheets whenever you need to contact a patient's family? We've got the solution!

NOKnock! Who's there? NOKnock is a fast :runner:, keyboard-driven :musical_keyboard: app for nursing homes to track patients, their Next‑of‑Kin (NOK) contacts, and caring sessions. It is optimized for day-to-day floor operations where speed :clock1:, accuracy :round_pushpin:, and auditability matter more than complex GUIs. All it takes is the ability to type short commands! :satisfied:

### Who is This Guide For?

- You are a **Singapore-based nursing home staff member** (nurse, care aide, coordinator, or supervisor) who:
    - is comfortable typing short commands or following copy‑paste instructions.
    - may have little or no prior CLI experience. No scripting knowledge is required.
    - wants a reliable, offline tool that works consistently across different computers.
- If you prefer point‑and‑click only, you can still use NOKnock's GUI window, but the fastest workflow uses commands.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** NOKnock is designed for Singapore-based nursing homes. Patient identification requires a valid Singapore NRIC number. For international or non-NRIC identifications, please contact support or consider alternative solutions.

New to the command line? You can copy each command from this guide and paste it into NOKnock’s command box. Start with the [5‑minute tutorial](#5-minute-tutorial) below to get confident quickly.

</box>

### Why a CLI-first app (and how NOKnock is different)

- **Speed and consistency**: Commands are quicker than navigating menus, especially for repetitive tasks (add → edit → schedule).
- **Fewer errors**: A structured command format reduces ambiguity and helps prevent duplicate or inconsistent records.
- **Works offline:** All data stays on your machine in a simple JSON file—no internet required.
- **Purpose‑built for nursing homes:** Built‑in linkage between Patient ⇄ NOK ⇄ Caring Sessions fits actual eldercare workflows.
- **Lightweight and portable:** A single .jar file you can run on any machine with Java `17` or higher.

## Quick start

1. Ensure your system meets the [system requirements](#system-requirements) and has Java `17` — see [Getting Java 17](#getting-java-17).
2. [Set up the app](#setting-up).
3. Type commands — follow the [5‑minute first task](#5-minute-tutorial) to try the core workflow.
4. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

### System requirements

- **Operating system:**
    - Windows 10 or 11 (x64)
    - macOS 12+ (Intel or Apple Silicon)
    - Linux (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 11+/Fedora 36+) with glibc compatible with Java `17`
- **Java:** JDK/JRE 17 or newer
- **Disk:** ~200 MB free (app + data headroom)
- **Permissions:** Write access to the folder containing the .jar
- **Network:** Only needed for downloads and updates

### Getting Java `17`

Choose one of the following:

- **Windows:** https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html
- **macOS:** https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html
- **Linux:** https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html

<box type="info" seamless>
If <code>java -version</code> fails, restart your terminal or computer, then try again. Reinstall Java if needed.
</box>

### Setting up

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from the Releases page:
   https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/releases

2. Choose (or create) a folder to act as your **NOKnock** home folder, and copy the `.jar` file into it.

3. Open a command terminal and change into that folder:
    - **Windows (PowerShell):**
      ```
      cd "C:\path\to\your\NOKnock"
      java -jar noknock.jar
      ```
    - **macOS/Linux (Terminal):**
      ```
      cd ~/NOKnock
      java -jar noknock.jar
      ```

4. A GUI should appear within a few seconds. The app starts with sample data so you can try commands immediately.

### 5-minute tutorial

Follow this quick walkthrough to learn the core workflow. Copy each command into NOKnock’s command box and press Enter.

**1) List current patients**

~~~
list-patients
~~~

**2) Add a new patient**

~~~
add-patient n/Aisha Tan ic/S1111111A w/2A t/diabetes
~~~

Expected:

~~~
New patient added: Aisha Tan
~~~

**3) Find your patient’s index**

~~~
find-patient aisha
~~~

Note the Index shown for “Aisha Tan” (e.g., `5`). Use that number in the next commands instead of `X`.

**4) Add a Next‑of‑Kin for that patient (replace `X` with patient index)**

~~~
add-nok X n/Daniel Tan p/6598765432 r/son
~~~

Expected:

~~~
Added NextOfKin: Daniel Tan to Patient: Aisha Tan
~~~

**5) Schedule a caring session (replace `X`; adjust date/time as needed)**

~~~
add-session X d/2025-10-31 time/09:30 type/medication notes/Metformin 500mg
~~~

Expected:

~~~
Added Caring Session: medication on 2025-10-31 at 09:30 to Patient: Aisha Tan
~~~

**6) View the full patient profile**

~~~
view-patient X
~~~

You’ll see Aisha’s details, linked NOK(s), and upcoming sessions in one place.

**7) Optional:** See today’s sessions

~~~
sessions-today
~~~

<box type="tip" seamless>
If you want the session to appear here, schedule one with today’s date.
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>
Made a typo? Use <code>edit-patient</code>, <code>edit-nok</code>, or <code>edit-session</code> to update fields; or the <code>delete-*</code> commands to remove entries. See Features below for full command formats and options.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be filled by the user.<br>
  e.g. `add-patient n/NAME ic/IC w/WARD → add-patient n/Dylan ic/S1234567A w/2A`

* Items in square brackets `[ ]` are optional.<br>
  e.g. `add-patient n/NAME ic/IC [t/TAG]` can be used with or without `t/TAG`.

* Items with `...` can appear multiple times (including zero if the item is optional).<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` → no tags, one tag, or many tags.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME w/WARD ic/IC` = `ic/IC w/WARD n/NAME`.

* Additional parameters for commands that do not accept them will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. `help abc` = `help`.

* Names accept letters (including accents), numbers, spaces, apostrophes ('), slashes (/), and hyphens (-)

* Avoid using command prefixes inside field values. Do not include n/, ic/, w/, t/ within names or other values, as they will be interpreted as new fields.
  Example: add-patient n/Javier w/o life ic/S1234567A → will be parsed as name = Javier, ward = o life (invalid).

* Only the documented prefixes are recognized. Any other xxx/ token (e.g., e/ or email/) is treated as part of the previous field’s value.
  e.g. w/2A e/email@gmail.com → will be read as ward = "2A e/email@gmail.com" and likely rejected by ward validation. Use only the prefixes shown in this guide.

* NOKnock automatically trims leading, trailing, and excess intermediate spaces in user input for key fields:
  e.g. <code>ic/S1234567A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> → <code>ic/S1234567A</code>,  
  <code>n/Jane&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doe</code> → <code>n/Jane Doe</code>.

* All of the commands are 1 indexed. E.g. `delete-patient 1` means deleting the first person.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Features

## Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

**Format:**
`help`

---

## Patient Management

### Listing all patients: `list-patients`

Displays all patients with basic information.

**Format:**  
`list-patients`

**Output:**

* Success → Table with Index, Name, IC, Ward, Tags, NOK List, Caring Session List
* None → Shows an empty table with column headers but no entries.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Using `list-patients` will automatically show all caring sessions (past and upcoming) for each patient in the right panel. By default, it should clear any filters applied by previous `find-patient` or `find-by-nok` commands.

</box>

![List Example](images/screenshots/screenshot_list.png)

### Adding a patient: `add-patient`

Creates a new patient record.

**Format:**  
`add-patient n/NAME ic/NRIC w/WARD [t/TAG]...`

**Examples:**

* `add-patient n/Dylan w/2A ic/S1234567A`
* `add-patient n/Javier w/8B ic/T9876543B t/diabetes t/mobilityIssues`

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important:** The IC field must contain a valid **Singapore NRIC** in the format `[S|T]XXXXXXX[A-Z]`:

- **S-prefix:** Singapore Citizen
- **T-prefix:** Singapore Permanent Resident (FIN holders not supported)
- **Example formats:** `S1234567A`, `T9876543B`

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** You can always enter the command phrase to be prompted the right usage of commands. The order of fields does not matter. For example, `add-patient t/Urgent ic/S2345678A w/2A n/Amy` is also valid.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Tags are optional and can be used to describe medical or care-related info.

</box>

**Output:**

* Success → `New patient added: Dylan`
* Duplicate → `A patient with this IC already exists in the database.`
* Invalid input → parameter-specific error message

**Note:** A patient is considered a **duplicate** when the **IC** matches exactly.

![help message](images/TipCommandHint.png)

### Editing a patient: `edit-patient`

Updates an existing patient’s information. At least one field must be provided.

**Format:**  
`edit-patient INDEX [n/NAME] [ic/IC] [w/WARD] [t/TAG]...`

**Examples:**

* `edit-patient 1 n/Yue Yang`
* `edit-patient 2 t/diabetes t/wheelchair`

**Output:**

* Success → `Edited Patient: Yue Yang`
* Invalid index → `The patient index provided is invalid`
* Duplicate IC → `A patient with this IC already exists in the database`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Possible Mistake**: `edit-patient 1` is incorrect because no field was provided.
**Tag Behavior**: 
* Supplying t/TAG during edit-patient replaces the entire set of tags.
* To remove all tags, use t/ with no values.

</box>

### Deleting a patient: `delete-patient`

Removes a patient and all associated data (NOKs, sessions).

**Format:**  
`delete-patient INDEX`

**Example:**  
`delete-patient 1`

**Output:**

* Success → `Deleted Patient: Yue Yang`
* Failure → `Invalid patient index. Please use a number from the patient list.`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:** Deleting a patient also deletes all related NOK and caring session data.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

Once the first person is deleted, the original second person becomes the first. To delete first N patients,
use the `delete-patient 1` command for N times

</box>

![Delete](images/TipDeletePatient.png)

![Delete](images/TipDeletePatientAfter.png)

### Viewing patient details: `view-patient`

Shows full patient details including NOKs and upcoming sessions.

**Format:**  
`view-patient INDEX`

**Example:**  
`view-patient 2`

**Output:**

* Success → Full profile with NOK list and upcoming sessions
* Failure → `The patient index provided is invalid`

![View](images/ViewPatient.png)

### Finding patients by name: `find-patient`

Search for patients by name (case-insensitive, partial matching).

**Format:**  
`find-patient KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

**Examples:**

* `find-patient dylan`
* `find-patient javier wong`

**Output:**

* Success → `X person(s) listed!` + list
* None → `0 person(s) listed!`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** You can enter multiple keywords(capitalised or non-capitalised is fine) to find more than 1 patient. E.g

</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Common error**: Keywords can match any part of a patient’s name from the start of a word. For example, searching Alex will match “Alex Tan” and “Tan Alex”, but not “Malex Tan” (since the match is in the middle of a word).

</box>

![Find](images/TipFindCommand.png)

![Find](images/TipFindCommandAfter.png)

### Finding patients by NOK name: `find-by-nok`

Search for patients based on their NOK’s name.

**Format:**  
`find-by-nok KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

**Examples:**

* `find-by-nok oad`
* `find-by-nok javier smith`

**Output:**

* Success → `1 person(s) listed!` + list
* None → `0 person(s) listed!`

---

## Next-of-Kin (NOK) Management

### Adding a NOK: `add-nok`

Adds a Next-of-Kin contact for a patient.

**Format:**  
`add-nok PATIENT_INDEX n/NAME p/PHONE r/RELATIONSHIP`

**Examples:**

* `add-nok 1 n/Oad p/6598765432 r/son`

**Output:**

* Success → `Added NextOfKin: Oad to Patient: Dylan`
* Duplicate → `This next of kin already exists for this patient`

**Note:** The `Relationship` field must match one of the valid values below:

| **Category**          | **Valid Relationships**                                                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Immediate Family**  | Father, Mother, Son, Daughter, Spouse, Husband, Wife                                     |
| **Siblings**          | Brother, Sister                                                                          |
| **Grand-family**      | Grandfather, Grandmother, Grandson, Granddaughter                                        |
| **In-laws**           | Father-in-law, Mother-in-law, Son-in-law, Daughter-in-law, Brother-in-law, Sister-in-law |
| **Extended Family**   | Uncle, Aunt, Cousin, Nephew, Niece                                                       |
| **Other Family**      | Granduncle, Grandaunt, Godparent                                                         |
| **Non-Family / Care** | Guardian, Caregiver, Friend, Neighbour, Domestic Helper                                  |
| **Miscellaneous**     | Other                                                                                    |

All relationships are **case-insensitive**, meaning entries like `father`, `Father`, or `FATHER` are treated as equivalent.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip**: you can always use the `list-patients` command to see the list of patients before deciding which patient the NOK should be added to.

</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:** A NOK is treated as a **duplicate** only if the **name**, **phone number**, and **relationship** all match an existing entry. This is because a patient may have multiple NOKs with the same name (e.g., two sons named John) or the same relationship (e.g., two daughters), or even a single person with different phone numbers, but it is rare for two distinct NOKs to share all three details exactly.

</box>

After adding a NOK, you should see something similar to the picture below

![AddNOK](images/TipAddNOKCommand.png)

### Editing a NOK: `edit-nok`

Updates NOK details.

**Format:**  
`edit-nok PATIENT_INDEX NOK_INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [r/RELATIONSHIP]`

**Example:**  
`edit-nok 1 1 p/6588888888`

**Output:**

* Success → `Edited NextOfKin: Jane Doe of Patient: Bernice Yu`
* Failure → `The patient/Next-of-Kin index provided is invalid`

### Deleting a NOK: `delete-nok`

Removes a NOK from a patient.

**Format:**  
`delete-nok PATIENT_INDEX NOK_INDEX`

**Example:**  
`delete-nok 1 2`

**Output:**

* Success → `Deleted NextOfKin: Oad`
* Failure → `The patient/Next-of-Kin index provided is invalid`

---

## Caring Session Management

### Adding a session: `add-session`

Schedules a care session for a patient.

**Format:**  
`add-session PATIENT_INDEX d/DATE time/TIME type/CARE_TYPE [notes/NOTES]`

**Examples:**

* `add-session 1 d/2025-10-31 time/14:30 type/medication notes/Give insulin shot`
* `add-session 2 d/25-10-2025 time/2:30pm type/hygiene`

**Output:**

* Success → `Added Caring Session: hygiene on 2024-12-25 at 14:30 to Patient: Dylan`
* Failure → parameter-specific error (e.g. invalid date/time)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note**: Two caring sessions for the same patient cannot be scheduled at the same date and time. If you attempt to add a session with identical date and time to an existing session, NOKnock will reject it.

Additionally, caring session **can be scheduled in the past.** This is to allow users to log past caring sessions that were not recorded at the time they occurred.

</box>

### Editing a session: `edit-session`

Edit an existing care session for a patient. You may also update the session status (`completed` or `incomplete`).

**Format:**
`edit-session PATIENT_INDEX SESSION_INDEX [d/DATE] [time/TIME] [type/CARE_TYPE] [notes/NOTES] [status/STATUS]`

**Examples:**

* `edit-session 1 1 d/2024-12-25 time/14:30 type/medication notes/Adjust dose status/completed`
* `edit-session 2 1 status/incomplete`

**Output:**

* Success → `Edited CaringSession: medication on 2024-12-25 at 14:30 of Patient: Dylan`
* Failure → parameter-specific error (e.g. invalid date/time or indices)

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Important**: `SESSION_INDEX` refers to the index of the session **for that specific patient**, not the global index across all sessions. It is ordered by the time each session was added to that patient.

To find the correct `SESSION_INDEX`:

1. Use `find-patient NAME` to locate your patient (if needed)
2. Use `view-patient PATIENT_INDEX` to see all sessions for that patient with their indices
3. Use the session index displayed in the `view-patient` output for your edit command

</box>

![Edit Session](images/TipEditSessionCommand.png)

### Deleting a session: `delete-session`

Deletes a care session from a patient.

**Format:**  
`delete-session PATIENT_INDEX SESSION_INDEX`

**Example:**
`delete-session 1 2`

**Output:**

* Success → `Deleted caring session for medication on 2025-10-31 at 14:30: Dylan`
* Failure → `The patient/caring session index provided is invalid`

### Viewing today’s sessions: `sessions-today`

Displays all caring sessions scheduled for today.

**Format:**  
`sessions-today`

**Output:**

* Success → `Today's caring sessions: X patients.` + list
* None → `Today's caring sessions: 0 patients. Type 'list-patients' to undo`

### Viewing this week's sessions: `sessions-week`

Displays all caring sessions scheduled for the current week (Monday to Sunday).

**Format:**  
`sessions-week`

**Output:**

* Success → `This week's caring sessions: X patients.` + list
* None → `This week's caring sessions: 0 patients. Type 'list-patients' to undo`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip**: To see all sessions across all patients (including past sessions) for record-keeping purposes, simply use: `list-patients`. This displays all patients and their associated caring sessions in one comprehensive view.

</box>

---

## Clearing Database

## Purging all data (irreversible)

Completely wipes all patients, NOKs, and caring sessions from the database. This operation cannot be undone and data cannot be recovered.

<box type="warning" seamless> This action is permanent. Ensure you have backed up `data/noknock.json` before proceeding. </box>

**Format:**
`i-understand-and-confirm-purge-database-will-lose-all-data`

**Output:**

* Success → Database (noknock.json) has been cleared!

After purging, you can start fresh or restore from a backup by replacing data/noknock.json while the app is closed.

---

## Data Management

### Saving the data

NOKnock data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

NOKnock data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/noknock.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:** If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NOKnock will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the NOKnock to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

<box type="wrong">

**Common mistake:** Directly editing the JSON file while NOKnock is running can lead to data corruption or loss. Always close the application before making any changes to the data file. **NOKnock will not be liable for any data loss resulting from concurrent edits.**

</box>

---

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous NOKnock home folder.

**Q**: Which files do I copy when migrating to another computer?<br>
**A**: Copy the entire `data` folder (especially `data/noknock.json`) from your old NOKnock home folder to the same location beside the `.jar` on the new machine. Optionally copy `preferences.json` to keep window size/position and UI settings.

**Q**: Where is my data stored?<br>
**A**: By default, in `[JAR folder]/data/noknock.json`. Preferences are saved in `[JAR folder]/preferences.json`.

**Q**: How do I back up and restore my data?<br>
**A**: Close the app, then copy `data/noknock.json` to a safe location. To restore, replace the existing `data/noknock.json` with your backup (while the app is closed).

**Q**: Can I change where data is saved?<br>
**A**: Not currently. Data is stored next to the `.jar` in `data/noknock.json`. To move the data, move the `.jar` and the `data` folder together to a new location.

**Q**: How do I update to a new version without losing data?<br>
**A**: Download the new `.jar` and place it in the same folder as your existing `data` folder. Keep the folder structure intact. You can rename the new file to `noknock.jar` or use the versioned file name when running `java -jar`.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
