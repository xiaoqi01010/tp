# NOKnock User Guide

<!--* Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

## What is NOKnock?

Do you have trouble keeping track of the care your patients need? Do you wish that you didn't have to go through entire Excel sheets whenever you need to contact a patient's family? We've got the solution!

NOKnock! Who's there? NOKnock is a fast :runner:, keyboard-driven :musical_keyboard: app for nursing homes to track patients, their Next‑of‑Kin (NOK) contacts, and caring sessions. It is optimized for day-to-day floor operations where speed :clock1:, accuracy :round_pushpin:, and auditability matter more than complex GUIs. All it takes is the ability to type short commands! :satisfied:

### Who is This Guide For?

- You are a nursing home staff member (nurse, care aide, coordinator, or supervisor) who:
    - is comfortable typing short commands or following copy‑paste instructions.
    - may have little or no prior CLI experience. No scripting knowledge is required.
    - wants a reliable, offline tool that works consistently across different computers.
- If you prefer point‑and‑click only, you can still use NOKnock’s GUI window, but the fastest workflow uses commands.

New to the command line? You can copy each command from this guide and paste it into NOKnock’s command box. Start with the “5‑minute first task” below to get confident quickly.

## Why a CLI-first app (and how NOKnock is different)

- Speed and consistency: Commands are quicker than navigating menus, especially for repetitive tasks (add → edit → schedule).
- Fewer errors: A structured command format reduces ambiguity and helps prevent duplicate or inconsistent records.
- Works offline: All data stays on your machine in a simple JSON file—no internet required.
- Purpose‑built for nursing homes: Built‑in linkage between Patient ⇄ NOK ⇄ Caring Sessions fits actual eldercare workflows.
- Lightweight and portable: A single .jar file you can run on any machine with Java `17` or higher.

## 5-minute tutorial

Follow this quick walkthrough to learn the core workflow. Copy each command into NOKnock’s command box and press Enter.

**1) List current patients**
~~~
list-patients
~~~

**2) Add a new patient**
~~~
add-patient n/Aisha Tan ic/S1234567A w/2A t/diabetes
~~~
Expected:
~~~
Patient added: Aisha Tan (S1234567A)
~~~

**3) Find your patient’s index**
~~~
find-patient aisha
~~~
Note the Index shown for “Aisha Tan” (e.g., 5). Use that number in the next commands instead of X.

**4) Add a Next‑of‑Kin for that patient (replace X with patient index)**
~~~
add-nok X n/Daniel Tan p/98765432 r/son
~~~
Expected:
~~~
NOK added for Aisha Tan: Daniel Tan (son, 98765432)
~~~

**5) Schedule a caring session (replace X; adjust date/time as needed)**
~~~
add-session X d/2025-11-01 time/09:30 type/medication notes/Metformin 500mg
~~~
Expected:
~~~
Caring session added for Aisha Tan: medication on 2025-11-01 at 09:30
~~~

**6) View the full patient profile**
~~~
view-patient 1
~~~
You’ll see Aisha’s details, linked NOK(s), and upcoming sessions in one place.

**7) Optional:** See today’s sessions
~~~
sessions-today
~~~

<box type="tip" seamless>
If you want the session to appear here, schedule one with today’s date.
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>
Made a typo? Use <code>edit-patient</code>, <code>edit-nok</code>, or <code>edit-session</code> to update fields; or the <code>delete-*</code> commands to remove entries. See Features below for full command formats and options.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be filled by the user.<br>
  e.g. `add-patient n/NAME ic/IC w/WARD → add-patient n/Dylan ic/S1234567A w/2A`

* Items in square brackets `[ ]` are optional.<br>
  e.g. `add-patient n/NAME ic/IC [t/TAG]` can be used with or without `t/TAG`.

* Items with `...` can appear multiple times (including zero if the item is optional).<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` → no tags, one tag, or many tags.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME w/WARD ic/IC` = `ic/IC w/WARD n/NAME`.

* Additional parameters for commands that do not accept them will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. `help abc` = `help`.

* NOKnock automatically trims leading, trailing, and excess intermediate spaces in user input for key fields:
  e.g. <code>ic/S1234567A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> → <code>ic/S1234567A</code>,  
  <code>n/Jane&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doe</code> → <code>n/Jane Doe</code>.

* All of the commands are 1 indexed. E.g. `delete-patient 1` means deleting the first person.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Format:**  
`list-patients`

**Output:**

* Success → Table with Index, Name, IC, Ward, Tags, NOK List, Caring Session List
* None → Shows an empty table with column headers but no entries.
<br/><br/>
  ![List Example](images/screenshots/screenshot_list.png)

### Adding a patient: `add-patient`

Creates a new patient record.

**Format:**  
`add-patient n/NAME ic/IC w/WARD [t/TAG]...`

**Examples:**

* `add-patient n/Dylan w/2A ic/S1234567A`
* `add-patient n/Javier w/8B ic/S9876543B t/diabetes t/mobility-issues`

<box type="tip" seamless>

</box>

![help message](images/TipCommandHint.png)

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Common mistakes**: It is common for one to enter the orders of fields wrongly, e.g.,

```
add-patient n/Amy ic/S1234567A w/2A
```

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Note:** Tags are optional and can be used to describe medical or care-related info.

</box>

**Output:**

* Success → `Patient added: Dylan (S1234567A)`
* Duplicate → `Patient with IC S1234567A already exists`
* Invalid input → parameter-specific error message

**Note:** A patient is considered a **duplicate** when the **IC** matches exactly.

### Editing a patient: `edit-patient`

Updates an existing patient’s information. At least one field must be provided.

**Format:**  
`edit-patient INDEX [n/NAME] [ic/IC] [w/WARD] [t/TAG]...`

**Examples:**

* `edit-patient 1 n/Yue Yang`
* `edit-patient 2 t/diabetes t/wheelchair`

**Output:**

* Success → `Patient updated: Yue Yang (S1234567A)`
* Invalid index → `Patient index X is out of range`
* Duplicate IC → `This patient already exists in the address book`

❌ **Possible mistake**: `edit-patient 1` is incorrect because no field was provided.
### Deleting a patient: `delete-patient`

Removes a patient and all associated data (NOKs, sessions).

**Format:**  
`delete-patient INDEX`

**Example:**  
`delete-patient 1`

**Output:**

* Success → `Patient deleted: Yue Yang`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:** Deleting a patient also deletes all related NOK and caring session data.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

Once the first person is deleted, the original second person becomes the first. To delete first N patients,
use the `delete-patient 1` command for N times

![Delete](images/TipDeletePatient.png)

![Delete](images/TipDeletePatientAfter.png)

</box>

### Viewing patient details: `view-patient`

Shows full patient details including NOKs and upcoming sessions.

**Format:**  
`view-patient INDEX`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip**: You can enter multiple keywords(capitalised or non-capitalised is fine) to find more than 1 patient. E.g

</box>

![Find](images/TipFindCommand.png)

![Find](images/TipFindCommandAfter.png)

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Common Mistake**: keywords must match at least 1 word in patient's name. A prefix will not yield
any result.

</box>

### Finding patients by NOK name: `find-by-nok`

Search for patients based on their NOK’s name.

**Format:**  
`find-by-nok KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

**Examples:**

* `find-by-nok oad`

* `add-nok 1 n/Oad p/98765432 r/son`
* `add-nok 2 n/Dr. Kapikapi p/6234-5678 r/doctor`

**Output:**

* Success → `Added NextOfKin: Oad to Patient: Dylan`
* Duplicate → `This next of kin already exists for this patient`

**Note:** A NOK is considered a **duplicate** when both the **Name** and **Phone** match exactly. *(Comparison is case-sensitive.)*

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip**: you can always use the `list-patients` command to see the list of patients before deciding which patient the NOK should be added to.

</box>

After adding a patient, you should see something similar to the picture below

![AddNOK](images/TipAddNOKCommand.png)

### Editing a NOK: `edit-nok`

Updates NOK details.

**Format:**  
`edit-nok PATIENT_INDEX NOK_INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [r/RELATIONSHIP]`

**Example:**  
`edit-nok 1 1 p/88888888`

**Output:**

* Success → `Edited NextOfKin: oad of Patient: Dylan`
* Failure → `The patient/Next-of-Kin index provided is invalid`

### Deleting a NOK: `delete-nok`

## Data Management

### Saving the data

NOKnock data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

NOKnock data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/noknock.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:** If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NOKnock will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the NOKnock to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous NOKnock home folder.

**Q**: Which files do I copy when migrating to another computer?<br>
**A**: Copy the entire `data` folder (especially `data/noknock.json`) from your old NOKnock home folder to the same location beside the `.jar` on the new machine. Optionally copy `preferences.json` to keep window size/position and UI settings.

**Q**: Where is my data stored?<br>
**A**: By default, in `[JAR folder]/data/noknock.json`. Preferences are saved in `[JAR folder]/preferences.json`.

**Q**: How do I back up and restore my data?<br>
**A**: Close the app, then copy `data/noknock.json` to a safe location. To restore, replace the existing `data/noknock.json` with your backup (while the app is closed).

**Q**: Can I change where data is saved?<br>
**A**: Not currently. Data is stored next to the `.jar` in `data/noknock.json`. To move the data, move the `.jar` and the `data` folder together to a new location.

**Q**: How do I update to a new version without losing data?<br>
**A**: Download the new `.jar` and place it in the same folder as your existing `data` folder. Keep the folder structure intact. You can rename the new file to `noknock.jar` or use the versioned file name when running `java -jar`.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
